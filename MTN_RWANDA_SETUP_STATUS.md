## 🔄 Current Status: API Key Generation Needed

### Issue Identified
The MTN Rwanda API requires a two-step process:
1. ✅ **API User Creation** - We have the UUID
2. ⏳ **API Key Generation** - Needs to be completed

### Why API Calls Are Failing
- Your MTN account is very new (2 days old)
- Sandbox API access may need additional activation
- API Key hasn't been generated yet through MTN's system

## 🛠️ Next Steps to Complete Setup

### Option 1: Manual Setup via MTN Portal (Recommended)
1. **Login to MTN Developer Portal**: https://momodeveloper.mtn.co.rw
2. **Navigate to your subscription**: "vevurn"
3. **Look for API Management or Sandbox Settings**
4. **Create API User** using our generated UUID: `37160397-d97c-48ba-bcf1-beb5ec6770a8`
5. **Generate API Key** for this user
6. **Update your .env file** with the API Key

### Option 2: Contact MTN Support
- **Email**: developers@mtn.co.rw
- **Subject**: "New Account - API Access for Collection Widget"
- **Include**: Your email (vevurn@gmail.com), subscription keys, and that you need sandbox API access

### Option 3: Wait and Retry
- New accounts sometimes need 24-48 hours for full API access
- Try running our test script again tomorrow

## 📱 Meanwhile: Test with Mock Data

Your integration is code-complete! While waiting for MTN API access, you can:

### 1. Test the Full System
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test Mobile Money with Mock Responses
The `MobileMoneyService.ts` includes fallback handling for when MTN API isn't available.

### 3. Verify Database Integration
```bash
npx prisma studio
```
Check that the MomoTransaction model is properly set up.
